# odin-binary-search-trees
odin15. This is a binary search tree class which can rebalance itself, insert/delete nodes, traverse the tree in preorder/inorder/postorder fashion, and more.

I wrote tests in script.js as I went along. The final driver code is found in driver.js. The driver code follows the "tie it all together" section at the bottom of the assignment.
